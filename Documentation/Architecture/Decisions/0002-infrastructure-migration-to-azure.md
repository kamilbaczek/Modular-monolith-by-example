# 2. Infrastructure_migration_to_Azure

Date: 2022-03-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Estimation Tool has advanced infrastructure like logging, observability, configuration, feature flags and etc.
Estimation Tool now uses few platforms like sentry, heroku etc. Platforms have different vendors. They are hard to
mantain and integrate with other. Infrastructure have to be unified. Options:

- Use Azure
- Use AWS
- Use Other Cloud Provider

## Decision

Decision is to use Azure because that platform is created by Microsoft like .Net. In result it easy to configure and has
tools integrated with .NET. Next important thing is that team is experienced with Azure. This is the best option for now
for this project.

## Consequences

Consequence can be vendor look and dependency with one platform. If in the future Azure will be more expensive or down.
This can have huge impact on project.
