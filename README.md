An Estimation Tool is a software or program that streamlines and simplifies the process of estimating costs of services. 
The Estimation Tool also offers an easy-to-use inquiry system that facilitates communication between the estimator and the client. With a user-friendly interface and built-in notifications, the tool ensures smooth and efficient communication, reducing the time and effort required to manage inquiries and respond to clients' requests. The system acts as a bridge between the estimator and the client, streamlining the process of inquiry and providing a centralized platform for all communication related to the estimation process. 

# Purpose of the project üéØ 

The purpose of the project is to provide guidance and inspiration for .NET developers in the community on how to build a system using a modular monolithic architecture style and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The focus is on showcasing the benefits and advantages of using a modular monolithic architecture, as well as demonstrating how to implement DDD principles in a .NET development environment. The goal is to help .NET developers understand how to design and develop systems that are scalable, maintainable, and flexible, while still providing a high degree of functionality and performance. By sharing the lessons learned and best practices developed through the creation of this system, the project aims to contribute to the advancement of the .NET development community and help developers to create better and more efficient software.
